# ParlorView

The goal of ParlorView (a stupid pun on _parlez-vous_) is to record audio from a microphone and call a translation service to generate real-time synthesized speech and/or captions in the target language. Translated speech output can be streamed via IceCast or similar and captions can be displayed via a website.
